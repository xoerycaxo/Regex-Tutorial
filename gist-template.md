# Regex Tutorial

Regular Expressions, or more commonly abbreviated as Regex, are powerful, case-sensitive patterns composed of single or a combination of single and special characters for the purpose of searching through and extracting information from text through matching, validating, locating, parsing, replacing, and/or managing target strings.

## Summary

In this Regex Rundown tutorial, we will be discussing validating a strong password by breaking down each component of the syntax below.

`^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[!@#\$%\^&\*])(?=.{8,})`

To satisfy the password strength criteria, a password must contain:

* At least 1 lowercase alphabetical character: `(?=.*[a-z])`
* At least 1 uppercase alphabetical character: `(?=.*[A-Z])`
* At least 1 numeric character: `(?=.*[0-9])`
* At least 1 special character: `(?=.*[!@#$%^&*])`
* A minimum of 8 characters: `(?=.{8,})`
